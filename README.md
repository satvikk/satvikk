### Hi there ðŸ––

I am Satvik Kishore. 
Weclome to my Github

Check out my:
- Personal website: www.satvikkishore.com

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Improving Computer Vision models used in Radiology by making them more Interpretable (Duke Interpretable AI Lab)
- Reducing Prediction Churn in Machine Learning Models. Prediction Churn can be thought of as the model inconsistencies that creep up when you re-train a model on new data.
